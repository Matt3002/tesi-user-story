# This is the name of the GitHub Actions workflow.
# It will be displayed in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
name: RAG Model CI Evaluation

# This section defines the trigger for the workflow.
# 'on: push:' means the workflow will run every time you push code.
# 'branches: [ main ]' specifies that it should only run for pushes to the 'main' branch.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.
jobs:
  # This job is named 'evaluate'. You can name it whatever you want.
  evaluate:
    # The type of virtual machine to run the job on. 'ubuntu-latest' is a standard and reliable choice.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # 'steps' represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check-out your repository's code.
      # This action allows the workflow to access all the files in your project.
      - name: Check-out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Python environment.
      # This specifies which version of Python to use.
      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      # Step 3: Install all the necessary dependencies.
      # This command reads your requirements.txt file and installs all the libraries.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Run the RAG evaluation script.
      # This is the core step of the workflow. It executes your main evaluation script.
      # The 'env' block is crucial for security: it maps the GitHub Secrets to
      # environment variables that the script can access safely.
